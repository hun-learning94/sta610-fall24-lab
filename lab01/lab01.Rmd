## ANOVA as a linear regression
Consider an one-way ANOVA model where an $i$th unit of a $j$th group is modeled as
$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{ij} &= \theta_j + \epsilon_{ij},\quad i\in[n],\;j\in[m]\\
\theta_j &\stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
$$
Another way to look at this model is as follows. First, we reparameterize the group mean parameters $\theta_j$ as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta_j = 
\begin{cases}
\alpha\quad &j=1\\
\alpha + \beta_{j-1}&j\geq 2
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$
Then you can check that the above model can be written as 
$$
\mathbb{y} = \alpha 1_{mn} + \mathbb{X}\beta + \mathbb{\epsilon}
$$
where $\mathbb{y} = [y_{11}, \cdots, y_{nm}]^T$, similary for $\mathbb{\epsilon}$ and $\beta = [\beta_1, \cdots,\beta_{m-1}]^T$.

#### Write down a form of a matrix $\mathbb{X}$.
